#   GRAPHITE_ROOT        - Root directory of the graphite installation.

#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/conf/
#   GRAPHITE_STORAGE_DIR - Storage directory for whipser/rrd/log/pid files.
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/storage/
#
# To change other directory paths, add settings to this file. The following
