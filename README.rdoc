= CAVEATS:

I didn't see an easy way to set Graphite's credentials easily.
I set those to root/root with an email address going no where.

Ships with two default schemas, stats.* (for Etsy's statsd) and a
catchall that matches anything. The catchall retains minutely data for
13 months, as in the default config. stats retains data every 10 seconds
for 6 hours, every minute for a week, and every 10 minutes for 5 years.
